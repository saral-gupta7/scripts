# ðŸ“œ Overview of My Scripts

## ðŸŽ§ 1. `audio`

> _"I named it `audio` because it originally just downloaded audioâ€¦ and I was too lazy to rename it later. ðŸ˜‚"_

This script is a lightweight, fun CLI tool that uses `yt-dlp` under the hood to download audio (and optionally video) from YouTube links. It also includes a slick menu powered by `fzf` for an interactive experience.

### ðŸ›  Dependencies

Before using the script, make sure you have these installed:

- **yt-dlp** â€“ Used for downloading and converting YouTube content.  
  Install via pip:

  If youâ€™re on macOS, install with:

  ```
- Or use the package manager appropriate for your OS.

#### ðŸš€ How to Use the Script

Once dependencies are installed:

3. Enter the output file name.
4. Paste the YouTube URL. 
5. Sit back and let the magic happen. ðŸª„
